data from the HTML to the server-side script.  They are set up so that someone clicking submit, or hitting enter would take 
the data and send it using a POST to some "action" URL (normally a PHP script).  
Nowadays we catch the action and don't send any data.  The reason you see them pop up on pages is because it's a fast way to let pressing enter do an action.  Otherwise you are listening for keypresses and deciding which key was pressed.  -->
