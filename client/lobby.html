<!-- Lobby Template: makes a link to each room in rooms.  Had to fiddle with the url to get the right link. 
My cloud9 browser wasn't showing me the added on #path part.  This is a common trick in single page apps, #whatev is an
old school trick to find an anchor named "whatev" in the page (by the way the links we make are in <a></a> tags because they
are the anchors).  That way you could jump to the middle of a very long HTML document.  The single page app world hacked
it to have links within the same page (no page refresh) and the framework would decide what to do with the part after the #.
