<!-- Not much to see here, I'm using Angular and needed AngularRoute to have multiple pages
The main HTML tag is registered to the "chatapp" module.  The body tag is registered as an angular view.

I had forgotten to insert that and debugged for a while trying to figure out why things weren't showing up.

Anyhow ng-view does away with the need to use ng-controller, the Router will handle templates and startup code.

  <body ng-view>
  </body>

<!-- the interesting script is at the end here, as a way of loading after the rest of the stuff.  Might be superstition we'll learn about requirejs later in the course (maybe) -->
